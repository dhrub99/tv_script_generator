# Generate TV Scripts
Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree `TV Script generation` project 

## Introduction
In this project, I have constructed a RNN model to generate it's own Seinfeld TV scripts. Here I have used a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network has generated a new, "fake" TV script for a hypothetical Season 10 of the show. ;-)

## Use Cases
You are welcome to use this model to input your own dataset of scripts and it'll generate a new one for you.
